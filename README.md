## About

Trippy is a little web application that allows you to create your own personal road trips by selecting different locations from the map.<br/><br/>
After logging in or signin up, you will be redirected to the home page where you will be able to either create a new trip or to look up at the trips you already created.
When creating a new trip, a little form will show up asking for the name of the trip and an image (if no image is uploaded a default image will be assigned to your trip).<br/><br/>
At this point you can start adding locations to your trip. Every time you want to add a new location, a form will show up allowing you to enter a name, a description, and to upload different images of the location.<br/>
After a location is created a marker will show up on the map, and by clicking on it a little popup will appear with the name and the image of the location. By clicking on the info icon, the info section will show up with the description of the location and a carousel with all the images uploaded.<br/><br/>
In the "My Trips" section you will have a preview with all the trips you previously created. By clicking on each one of the trip cards you will be redirected to the map showing you all the markers connected by a line showing you the itinerary.
